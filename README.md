**-Downloaded and Installed VirtualBox**
Used VirtualBox as the virtualization platform to host the virtual machine.

**-Downloaded Microsoft Windows ISO**
Obtained the official Microsoft ISO file to install as the guest operating system in the VM.
Note: Microsoft provides evaluation versions that allow free usage for testing and development.

**-Created Folder Structure**
Created a directory named SOC101 and added the ISO file to it for organization.

**-Launched Virtual Machine**
Imported the ISO file into VirtualBox and started the VM to begin the Windows installation process.

**-Resolved Errors**
Encountered error:
Hyper-V-VT-x is not available (VERR_VMX_NO_VMX)
Solution:
Disabled Hyper-V using the following command in an elevated Command Prompt:

bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off

**-Installed Windows OS**
Proceeded with the Windows installation after resolving virtualization conflicts.

**-Created Snapshot**
Took a snapshot (Machine > Take Snapshot) post-installation in case a rollback is needed later.

## üîê Windows Defender Configuration
To simulate a more open threat environment for malware analysis and detection practice:

Disabled Tamper Protection from Windows Security settings.

Used PowerShell to disable several Defender features:

Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
Set-MpPreference -DisableIOAVProtection $true
Set-MpPreference -DisableScanningMappedNetworkDrivesForFullScan $true
Set-MpPreference -DisableBlockAtFirstSeen $true
Set-MpPreference -DisableAntiSpyware $true
## üìö Lessons Learned
VirtualBox requires VT-x (Intel Virtualization) to be enabled.
Hyper-V conflicts with VirtualBox, so Hyper-V must be disabled to run VMs effectively.

Command Prompt must be run as Administrator when executing bcdedit or other system-level commands.
